Schedule Maker
(Class structure draft)

A Schedule Maker is a program that allows users to create, update, and schedule plans efficiently. The program allows users to create schedules for a day, month, or year and add events without any clash.

To implement a Schedule Maker in Java, we can implement an object-oriented approach by creating a number of classes that encapsulate different features of the system. The following is a suggested framework:


1) Main class
-Running the program


2) ScheduleManager class (manages all the created schedules)
-Adding a schedule
-Removing a schedule
-Getting a schedule
-Listing all the schedules


3) Schedule class (creates full schedules for a day/week/month)
-Adding an event
-Removing an event
-Listing all events 


4) Event class (creates an event)
-Checking if an event is overlapping with other events
