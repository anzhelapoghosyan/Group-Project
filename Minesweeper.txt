Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a single-player board based game, in which player must open grids by avoiding the ones containing mine. Here's the logic: when you open a cell it must show the number of the mines adjacent to it (horizontally, vertically, diagonally), is there is mine instead- the game ends. The challenge is to use logic to avoid mines while uncovering all safe cells.
To implement Minesweeper in Java, we can use an object-oriented approach by defining multiple classes that represent different parts of the game. Below is a suggested structure:

1. Cell Class
Represents a single cell in the Minesweeper grid.
Stores whether the cell contains a mine, has been revealed, or is flagged.
Stores the number of adjacent mines.
Provides methods to reveal the cell, toggle a flag, and update its state.

2. Board Class
Manages the 2D grid of Cell objects.
Initializes the board with empty cells.
Places mines randomly on the board.
Calculates the number of adjacent mines for each cell.
Provides methods for revealing cells and checking game status.

3. Game Class
Manages the game loop and player interactions.
Takes user input for selecting cells.
Checks for win/loss conditions.
Displays the board state.
